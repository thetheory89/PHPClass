* Please follow the instructions below.
*
* The super global $_SESSION is used to store data that can be
* used on other pages. Unlike $_POST and $_GET session data is
* stored on the server and then populated back into Session
*
* In order for session to work look at line 14. That function
* must run before sessions can be used in PHP
*
* 1. Create a session variable called 'auth' and set it to false.
*
* 2.When the user submits the form check for the passcode 'demo'
* if the pass code is correct set the session variable auth to true and
* redirect them to itemD.php
*
* If you need a hint, look at itemD.php you cannot enter the page unless
* itemC.php is complete.
