* Please follow the instructions below.
*
The link on the page is linked to the same page using a pound sign/hash tag
* you can access the url params with the $_GET super global
* $_GET gets populated by PHP when URL params are passed to the webpage.
* $_GET is an array with key=>value pairs.
*
* Just to clarify, super globals in PHP is variables that are always available
* for the programmer to use. $_GET is always available, but data is not populated
* until url params are passed into the page.
*
* 1. do a print_r (used for printing array values) on the super Global $_GET
* when you enter the page week6/itemA.php you will see the array is empty
* in order for PHP to populate the array you must pass values into the URL
*
* 2. Use the count() function to determine if $_GET values have been passed in the url
* and populated with a key=>value pair. To populate the $_GET you can click on the link
* below or you can enter your own key=value pairs.
* Remember to start a url query use the question mark (?) followed by a key name, an equal sign
* then a value. You can continue to add more by then adding a ampersand & into the mix.
* The limit is about 256 characters, but can vary based on the browser.
* Data passed in a $_GET is not secure.
*
* 3. Add two more url params to the link below. Send a state and city.
*
* 4. When values are passed to the URL please echo them back to the page.
* you can access the populated $_GET variables by putting the key name in brackets after
* the variable. make sure to include quotes since the name is a string
* e.g $_GET['name']
* to output use echo. echo takes a string so if you want to concat a string with
* a variable use the period(.)
* e.g. echo 'Your name is ' . $_GET['name'];
*
