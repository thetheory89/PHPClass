* Please follow the instructions below.
*
* The Form on the page will post the data entered back to this page.
* The data sent will be populated by PHP into the Super Global $_POST
* $_POST holds the data in a key=>value pair array.
*
* 1. use the print_r() function on the $_POST super global.
* you will notice the array is empty. Enter data into the form and submit
* Data has now been populated from the form into the $_POST array.
*
* 2. You can now access the $_POST but you should only echo the results
* or process anything is a post has been made. use the count() function to
* echo the $_POST results for each input field. there should be 3 results.
*
* 3. Comment out the email field and submit your form. You should get a warning or
* error. Just a check to see that the POST had been populated with data is just
* not enough use this function filter_input(INPUT_POST,'email')
* We normally would just get the data with $_POST['email'] Which ever way you
* choose to is fine but the filter_input function will not throw an error when
* you try to get a $_POST key that does not exisit. Submit the form with the
* email field still commented out and see what it does. Also check PHP.net for
* more information about the function.
